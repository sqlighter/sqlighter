## Site

Just a random collection of thoughts and links to site I like that can be used as inspiration for building a one page site in the nowadays pretty much standard one pager format.

basic structure
classic saas one pager

examples:
https://www.google.com/gmail/about/
https://angel.co/
https://ready.so/
https://www.angellist.com/stack
https://www.intercom.com/drlp/business-growth-sb

Initially copy gmail visuals as placeholders to give the illustrator an idea of the formats, aspect ratios, (low) level of detail to be used. Will be redrawn as originals once site and copy are in place.

## Header
- logo with logotype
- translucent background https://ready.so/
- github stars with handwritten note "send your love" 
- try button all over the place like intercom with "try today"
